Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 4th year PhD neuroscience student working in the [CoAx lab](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My advisor is Timothy Verstynen. Previously, I earned an M.S. in formal symbolic logic at Carnegie Mellon University.  Â  

I am interested in the intersection of neurobiology and AI. I You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
