Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 5th year neuroscience PhD student in then [CNUP](http://cnup.neurobio.pitt.edu) working in the CoAx lab at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Dr. Timothy Verstynen](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/). My research involves decoding neural activity. I am interested in how principles from neurobiology (e.g. cell type specific network wiring) might improve deep learning architectures, and the algorithmic differences between state-of-the-art synthetic and biological computation. Previously, I completed an M.S. in formal symbolic logic at Carnegie Mellon University. 

You can see all of my work here: [CV](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/resumes/beukema.pdf). 

I am also a very big fan of bicycling and believe that we should dramatically increase bicycling infrastructure throughout the United States. Drop me a line if you need pro-bono work done on anything data-oriented (e.g. machine learning/data-science) related to cycling advocacy.
