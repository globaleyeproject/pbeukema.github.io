Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 5th year PhD student at the Center for Neuroscience working in the [CoAx lab](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Dr. Timothy Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/verstynen-timothy.html). My research involves decoding neural activity during skilled movement, because skilled movement is disrupted in disease, and because maybe we can accelerate learning by understanding how it is encoded. Previously, I completed an M.S. in formal symbolic logic at Carnegie Mellon University. [cv](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/resumes/beukema.pdf). 

I am also very interested in the problem of reproducibility in biomedical research & neuroscience, and how we can improve the scientific process. 

Over the last year, I have been compiling advice for graduate students in neuroscience and recently turned what was a github repository into an easier to read [web page](https://pbeukema.github.io/LabHacks/).
