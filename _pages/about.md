Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 5th year PhD student at the Center for Neuroscience working in the CoAx labat Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Dr. Timothy Verstynen](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/). My research involves decoding neural activity. Previously, I completed an M.S. in formal symbolic logic at Carnegie Mellon University. 

You can see all of my work here: [CV](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/resumes/beukema.pdf). 

I am also a very big fan of bicycling and believe that we should dramatically increase bicycling infrastructure throughout the United States. Drop me a line if you need pro-bono work done on anything data-oriented (e.g. machine learning/data-science) related to cycling advocacy.
