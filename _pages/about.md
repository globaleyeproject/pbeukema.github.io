Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am currently working on building an artificially intelligent brain machine interface at a startup in the DC area. I am also interested in building open science tools and exploring Arc Reactor Technology. I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience (University of Pittsburgh) and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (Carnegie Mellon University). My dissertation examined the neural representational geometries underlying motor learning plasticity. Before that, I worked on how causal inference could be encoded within recurrent neural networks.
