Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am currently working on neural decoding at a startup in the DC area. I am also interested in building open science tools to improve the very low reproducibility rates in biomedical research. I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (Pitt/Carnegie Mellon). My dissertation examined the neural code for motor learning. Before that, I earned an M.S. in logic from CMU, where I worked on a recurrent neural network implementation of causal inference.
