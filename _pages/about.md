Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 4th year neuroscience PhD student working in the [CoAx lab](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Dr. Timothy Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/people/core-training-faculty/verstynen-timothy.html). Previously, I earned an M.S. in formal symbolic logic at Carnegie Mellon University.    

I am broadly interested in the intersection of neurobiology and AI. My research involves decoding neural patterns of activity to better understand motor control. I am also very interested in the problem of reproducibility in biomedical research & neuroscience, and how we can improve the scientific resarch process. You can find my academic cv [here](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/resumes/beukema.pdf). 

Over the last year, I have been compiling advice for graduate students in neuroscience and recently turned what was a github repository into an easier to read [web page](https://pbeukema.github.io/LabHacks/) .
