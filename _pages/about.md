Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am currently working on building an artificially intelligent brain machine interface (like in Iron Man) at a startup in the DC area. I am also interested in building open science tools to improve the very low reproducibility rates in biomedical research. I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience (University of Pittsburgh) and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (Carnegie Mellon University). My dissertation examined the neural representational geometries underlying motor learning plasticity. Before that, I earned an M.S. in logic from CMU, where I worked on how causal inference could be encoded within recurrent neural networks.
