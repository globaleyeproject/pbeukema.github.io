Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am currently working on articially intelligent brain machine interfaces at a startup in DC. I am also interested in open science and ART (Arc Reactor Technology). Previously I completed a PhD in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience (U. Pitt) and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (Carnegie Mellon). My thesis examined the neural representational geometries underlying plasticity. Before that I worked on how causal inference could be encoded within recurrent neural networks.
