Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 5th year neuroscience PhD student in the [CNUP](http://cnup.neurobio.pitt.edu) working in the [CoAx lab](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. Timothy Verstynen. My research involves decoding neural activity. Previously, I completed an M.S. in formal logic at Carnegie Mellon University. [CV](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/resumes/beukema.pdf). 

I am also a very big fan of bicycling and believe that we should dramatically increase bicycling infrastructure throughout the United States. Drop me a line if you need pro-bono work done on anything data-oriented (e.g. machine learning/data-science) related to cycling advocacy.
