Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am interested in research at the intesection of human learning and artificial intelligence, as well as in improving the reliability of biomedical research through open science. Previously I received a PhD in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience. My thesis examined the neural representational geometries associated with learning. Before that I worked on causal inference with recurrent neural nets at Carnegie Mellon University. Here is my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pbeukema/pbeukema.github.io/blob/master/resume.pdf).
