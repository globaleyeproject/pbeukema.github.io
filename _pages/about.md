Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am interested in human learning, AI, and open science. Previously I completed a PhD in neuroscience from the Center for Neuroscience (U. Pitt) and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (Carnegie Mellon). My thesis examined the neural representational geometries underlying plasticity. Before that I worked on how causal inference could be encoded within recurrent neural networks.
