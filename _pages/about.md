Hi! My name is Patrick Beukema. I am a 5th year neuroscience PhD student in the [CNUP](http://cnup.neurobio.pitt.edu) working in the [CoAx lab](http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~coaxlab/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research involves looking for low dimensional markers of neural plasticity after motor learning. Previously, I completed an M.S. in formal logic at Carnegie Mellon University. Here is my [CV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pbeukema/pbeukema.github.io/blob/master/resume.pdf). I am interested in research at the intesection of artificial intelligence and motor learning, as well as in improving the reliability of biomedical research. 

I am also a very big fan of bicycling and believe that we should dramatically increase bicycling infrastructure throughout the United States. Drop me a line if you need pro-bono work done on anything data-oriented (e.g. machine learning/data-science) related to cycling advocacy.
