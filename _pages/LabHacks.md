## Data analysis
* Start every new research project with a clear and universal directory structure for organizing your analysis, data and figures. [Here](http://nikola.me/folder_structure.html) is a template as an example you can follow for a transparent directory structure.  

* Download [Atom](https://atom.io/). It is a very powerful and free! editor that integrates nicely with github.
Use it for writing text, markup, code, scripts, etc.

* Use [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for development and for analysis pipelines. Install [Kyle Dunovan's](https://github.com/dunovank) [jupyter themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes) to make your notebooks pretty and work faster.

* Consider [version-controlling your data](https://dataversioncontrol.com/) along with your [code](https://github.com). 

* Make an "autopilot" script for your analyses, so that figures can be updated in real time. Then write a [cron job](https://healthchecks.io/docs/cron/) to execute the analysis script so that newly collected data is automatically integrated perhaps with an email summarizing the results sent to you or your advisor. Example [here](https://github.com/pbeukema/rsaRemap/blob/master/modmap_autopilot.py).

* Make a startup file for your jupyter notebooks that preloads modules like numpy and scipy and figure specifications so they are consistent and pub ready. The config file can specify font sizes, legends, color themes etc.

* Learning data science? [Here](https://unsupervisedmethods.com/cheat-sheet-of-machine-learning-and-python-and-math-cheat-sheets-a4afe4e791b6) is an extremely well curated series of quick references for data science in python (numpy, scipy, pandas), ML algorithms, probability and more

* Diving into deep learning? [Here](https://startupsventurecapital.com/essential-cheat-sheets-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-researchers-efb6a8ebd2e5) is a similar reference for machine learning (ML) and deep learning.

##  Programming
* Start using github. It is excellent for version control and for sharing. Consider how many times you have written a script called analysis_v5_final_reallyfinal_thistime_final.py. With github you will just have analysis.py. With github, other researchers can replicate exactly what you did. This will ultimately save you time, if someone emails you for example.
* If you write software for the use of the greater scientific community, it will be a lot easier for others to port your code and collaborate if you follow a standard set of guidelines when packaging your project for release (e.g. on github). Here is a [template](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona) to follow written by Ariel Rokem. 

* A lot of open software that is developed for neuroscience runs on either Linux or OSX but not Windows. So consider installing Linux. [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/) is a popular distribution that has extensive support if you get stuck.

* After installing Linux, learn the [art of the command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)

* Do you use Matlab? It is worth considering a switch to [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python offers simpler syntax, enables system wide interfacing, is open source, free and for these reasons is being used by more and more scientists. Replication is far easier with Python than Matlab.

* Now want to learn Python?
  * Everyone in our lab learned the basic syntax with [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). 52 exercises spanning installing Python to building a web app. 
  * Here is a [Python Bootcamp notebook](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp/blob/master/ProgrammingWithPython.ipynb) that provides excellent advice on learning Python, written by Tom Donoghue. 
  * Read the [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to write "pythonic" code. 
  * Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is a scientific distribution of python that enables high performance computing and analysis.
  * Package your python project with this amazing [guide](http://veekaybee.github.io/2017/09/26/python-packaging/) by Vicki Boykis
  * Learn numpy (a package for scientific computing) with [these 100 exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100%20Numpy%20exercises%20no%20solution.ipynb) written by Nicolas Rougier.
  * Become a python data ninja. Thomas Wiecki provides a [great introduction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/twiecki/pydata_ninja/blob/master/PyData%20Ninja.ipynb#/) to data science in python.
  

* Use hotkeys for [google](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en), [gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), [atom](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts), [jupyter notebooks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) & and  [bash](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html). Consider a mechanical keyboard so your labmates love you, then hotkey your keyboard to eliminate typing entirely.

* Not sure how to code something? It may have an answer on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Even professional programmers use stack overflow.

* Access anything or anywhere on your computer with minimal effort using Keyboard launchers like [Albert](https://github.com/albertlauncher/albert) for linux and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for mac.

* Learn how to simulate data to ensure that your analysis works the way you think it does.

* A basic understanding of [data structures](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/10-common-data-structures-explained-with-videos-exercises-aaff6c06fb2b) is useful for optimizing larger scale projects.

* Need to sync files across your various lab computers/clusters and laptop you use at home and don't want to use Dropbox? Use [rsync](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories-on-a-vps) instead. e.g:
```bash
rsync -zavr -e ssh --delete --include '*/' --include='*include_these_files.[ext]' --exclude='*' [local_dir] [remote_server]:[remote_dir]
```

##  Generating publication quality figures
* If you followed the programming advice above, you are now convinced that Python is your favorite language. Python has excellent data visualization built off [matplotlib](http://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html) and a library called [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html).

* Use your plotting software of choice (e.g. seaborn) to get your figure as close to final as possible. Avoid having to make post-edits in illustrator/inkscape which can be a huge time sink as a graduate student.

* Carefully consider the colors and colormaps of your figures. How would color blind readers interpret your figures?

* Understand why people hate the [jetmap colormap](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/10/16/how-bad-is-your-colormap/). Read about different colormaps [here](https://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html).

* If you use Matlab, try out the [gramm toolbox](https://github.com/piermorel/gramm), inspired by R's ggplot2. 

* Have a look at the tutorials on [flowingdata](http://flowingdata.com/) for excellent data visualization.

* Save your figures in svg, or eps, not png. 

##  Statistical analysis
* If you are new to statistics, start [here](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/) to grok the fundamentals.

* See this [tutorial](http://m-clark.github.io/documents/) on machine learning concepts, because you haven't had enough.  

* Learn to love Bayesian statistics, if you don't already.
[This](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/) is an introduction on bayesian vs. frequentist statistics written by [Jake Vanderplas](https://staff.washington.edu/jakevdp/), an astrophysicist and python developer.

* Beware of p-values and null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) the de facto standard in neurobio research, cognitive neuroscience and biomedical research:
  * [Beyond the dead salmon talk](slides.com/neuro_logical/pvps): p-values, p-value problems, power in neuroscience, reproducibility crisis, replication, and strategies for overcoming these problems. 
  * Regina Nuzzo on how not to get fooled by p-values: [video](https://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=26200&bhcp=1Read)
  * Problems with p-values: [1](http://ejwagenmakers.com/2007/pValueProblems.pdf) [2](https://peerj.com/articles/3544.pdf)
  * How to proceed: [Abandon statistical thresholds](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)
  
* As soon as possible, understand:
  * [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)) -- insanely powerful. 
  * [cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) -- enables generalization
  * [permutation tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)) -- gets you a null distribution, sometimes hard to analytically derive in closed form
  * [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11TozBxAaON1eFXeL6aK1USLtJyAbUaHhskcPkI0FLbc/edit#slide=id.g138cbbed1a_0_0 ) are some lecture notes that look at these topics in the context of multivariate pattern analysis in fMRI.
   
*	Do not let your test data into your training data (i.e. double dipping)

* [Rob Kass](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/), @CMU statistics, has written the extremely useful [Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961).

* There are many texts on data analysis, but Cosma Shalizi [textbook](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf) is brilliant. 

* Understand the bias/variance [trade off](https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/2017/07/13/tutorial-4/)

* Do you know what the chris rock effect is in statistics? Expand your statistical lexicon [here](http://andrewgelman.com/2009/05/24/handy_statistic/).

* Are you still not using hierarchical Bayes? Thomas Wiecki will show you the [way](http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/). [Everything is a trivial case of hierarchical Bayesian inference](https://twitter.com/farlkriston/status/699515098050723840). 

* Frequent [datatau](http://www.datatau.com/) for interesting news on data analysis.

* Your stats question may have an answer over [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/) on cross-validated.

  * [Pythonic perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io/)

  * [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](http://andrewgelman.com/)

  * Wagenmakers new blog! [Bayesian Spectacles](https://www.bayesianspectacles.org)
##  Giving talks
* [Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ) on giving scientific talks. 



##  Writing papers
* See these [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619
), written by [Konrad Kording](http://koerding.com/) and Brett Mensh.

* Also, have a look at [this](http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/30/advice_on_writi/) more general advice for writing papers by Andrew Gelman. 

* Publish your paper to one of the [arXivs](http://www.biorxiv.org/submit-a-manuscript). If your PI doesn't support that, convince them.

* If you are frustrated with writing, read [this](http://lithub.com/how-academics-survive-the-writing-grind-some-anecdotal-advice/)
* Share your work with your friends as well as your enemies, the latter might give you even better criticism.

* Steven Pinker has some interesting thoughts on how to make academic writing [better](http://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/why_academics_stink_at_writing.pdf)

* If you are struggling to write scientific papers in word, e.g. embedding equations, consider using [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org) (pronounced "Lay-Tech"). Latex allows you to focus on writing rather than formatting.

##  fMRI
* Know your neuroanatomy. Julian Caspers, a neuroradiologist, provided a great set of [guidelines](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/files/2017/ED%20Courses/Course%20Materials/Anatomy_Caspers_Julian.pdf) at the 2017 Organization for Human Brain Mapping conference. You also may find this interactive [brain explorer](http://www.brainfacts.org/3D-Brain#intro=false&focus=Brain-cerebral_hemisphere-right) useful.

* Standardize your imaging data set using the [BIDS format](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/) - this will make your data more accessible to both your collaborators and the field at large.

* As a benchmark, you should be able to write down the [general linear model](http://www.brainvoyager.com/bvqx/doc/UsersGuide/StatisticalAnalysis/TheGeneralLinearModel.html) you are using from scratch and solve it in closed form.

* Understand the difference between [univariate and multivariate approaches](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01857.pdf) to fMRI

* Next learn [representational similarity analysis](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005508) & the related [crossnobis](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1608/1608.02027.pdf) distance measure, a powerful framework that can bridge behavior, imaging, and computational models.  

* You will need a visualization tool. A lot of labs have success with [MRIcroGL](http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricrogl/home) or [the connectome workbench](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench). Recently [James Gao](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2015.00023/full) written an indredibly powerful new tool called [PyCortex](https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex) which uses WebGL to render the flat maps and fiducial surfaces in your browser, you can even project movies on the surface.  

* Improve your understanding of anatomy with the web based user interface for exploring the human brain called [Cortical Explorer](http://corticalexplorer.com).

* Before you get really deep in your design, check out [NeuroSynth](http://neurosynth.org) (written by Tal Yarkoni) to run a meta analysis on your covariates of interest to see what has been done before. 

##  MEG
*	[MNE-python](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) is the go-to for source localization and sensor space data processing
    
## Doing ECoG
*	For localizing surface electrodes see this [python toolbox](https://github.com/ChangLabUcsf/img_pipe) 
    
## Doing structural MRI
*	You’ve probably already heard of [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)—necessary for cortical reconstruction, parcellation, ROI definition, structural analysis, and lot’s of other functionalities

*	Check out [SUMA-AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/Suma) for surface based analyses and commonly employed MRI statistical analysis

*	You’ll need to get familiar with bash scripting if you’re going to utilize the wealth of resources the field has to offer

*	Learn about subject, MRI, and average reference spaces so you know how to go from individual subject to group-wide analyses: [link](http://freesurfer.net/fswiki/CoordinateSystems)
    *	Understand the concept of [Freesurfer spheres](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/SurfaceRegAndTemplates)—there are a variety of other software packages that use them to re-reference subject coordinates

##  Analyzing ephys data
* Most ephys lab use in house analysis routines in (sometimes) relatively closed source and (oftentimes) expensive applications. Pavan Ramkumar @KordingLab has written an excellent open source [package](https://github.com/KordingLab/spykes) for spike data analysis and visualization in Python.

##  Biophysical and molecular modeling
* Start [here](http://mmbios.org/index.php/software#anm) for a variety of software resources on realistic cellular, especially [MCell](http://www.mcell.org/index.html) and [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/courses).

* Check out [CellBlender](https://github.com/mcellteam/cellblender) for visualization and simulation of realistic 3D cellular models.

* Keep a digital lab notebook with [Benchling](https://benchling.com/academic), free for academics.

* Try [ApE](http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/) for creating plasmid maps/visualization of restriction sites and planning experiments.

* Recreate expensive hardware on the cheap with [labrigger](http://labrigger.com/blog/)

* [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) is a free and easy to use image processsor.

##  Literature search
* You will need a citation manager early on, [PaperPile](https://paperpile.com) is a good one that is well integrated with Pubmed
    *	[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) is a free alternative
    
* Find articles before they are officially published on [arxiv](http://biorxiv.org/)

* You can search the literature with [Pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) & [Google-scholar](https://scholar.google.com). Now is a good time to make your own google scholar account if you don't have one. Also, stay on top of your favorite authors' publications with [Google-scholar's alerts](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts&hl=en).

* Before you start down some major project that you will be committed to for years, understand the current literature in your topic. Understand very clearly why you are going to do what you are going to do.

* Be skeptical of author's use of the word prediction, often what they really mean is in-sample linear correlation, and not what prediction actually means, out-of-sample generalization of a model. [Here](http://pilab.psy.utexas.edu/publications/Yarkoni_Westfall_PPS_in_press.pdf) Tal Yarkoni provides some insights.


## Grant writing
* Be aware of what grants have been funded in your field, by searching [nih reporter](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm). This will tell you what was funded, the program officer, the PI, etc.

##  Meetings
* Never show up empty handed to meetings with your PI.
* Have a clear objective to all meetings that everyone else knows as well.
* Be able to show some evidence of your productivity.

* You will have some days or weeks where nothing worked. I found that in those cases it is productive to have a "rainy day" folder containing interesting analyses/figures you have not yet shown.
